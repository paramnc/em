title: New Credit Structure for Startup Accelerator Program
description: As part of our startup accelerator program, we currently offer $200 off Vercel for 6 months ($1200 in total credits). This offer is available to startups through the venture capital firms and accelerators we partner with (eg. YCombinator, Sequoia, etc.) What changes would you recommend that we make to this credit structure?

3.  Third point
